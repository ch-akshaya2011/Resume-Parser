Problem Statement:
The traditional hiring process can be time-consuming and inefficient for both job applicants and 
recruiters. Applicants are often required to manually apply for multiple jobs and recruiters must sift 
through numerous resumes to find suitable candidates. It involves a lot of manual work and is often 
time consuming and expensive. Sorting through numerous applications and resumes can be 
overwhelming, and sometimes candidates with the right qualifications are overlooked. This can lead 
to missed opportunities for both parties and a lack of diversity in the hiring process. 

Problem Description:
We have used Machine learning and Natural Language Processing. We have also used pickling for the prediction. It has shown the accuracy of the prediction about 98 percent. Representation in graphical diagrams using matplotlib and seaborn. Conversion of categorical data to numerical data using label encoder, And also we have used TFIDF vectorizer for the vectorization. We have also added the feature for the suggested applicants to the employers for easy selection and for the applicants they can check whether they are selcted or not using our feedback feature.
